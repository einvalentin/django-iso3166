Description: ==============
        Django ISO3166
        ==============
        
        ``ISO 3166`` is a three-part standard published by the Organization for
        Standardization (ISO), and defines codes for the names of countries, dependent
        territories, and special areas of geographical interest, and their principal
        subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states). The official name is Codes for the
        representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.
        
        This project only uses one part of the standard, ISO 3166-1, It defines three
        sets of country codes:
        
        * alpha-2 : two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the
        three.
        * alpha-3 : three-letter country codes.
        * numeric : three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed
        and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage
        of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or
        systems using non-Latin scripts.
