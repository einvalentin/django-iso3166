Django ISO3166
==============

``ISO 3166`` is a three-part standard published by the Organization for
Standardization (ISO), and defines codes for the names of countries, dependent
territories, and special areas of geographical interest, and their principal
subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states). The official name is Codes for the
representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.

This project only uses one part of the standard, ISO 3166-1, It defines three
sets of country codes:

* alpha-2 : two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the
  three.
* alpha-3 : three-letter country codes.
* numeric : three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed
  and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage
  of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or
  systems using non-Latin scripts.
